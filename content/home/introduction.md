<!--more-->
We study marine microbial ecology and evolution through a variety of field, lab, and bioinformatic approaches. The broad research theme in our lab can be defined as how biotic and abiotic factors interact with microbial lineages to shape the marine food web and biogeochemistry. Some of our current research areas include:<br>
<br>
•	Interactions of giant viruses with microbial eukaryotes (protists).<br>
•	Linking giant viruses with their potential hosts <i>in situ</i> to answer 'who infects whom?'<br>
•	The role of viruses in modulating harmful algal blooms in coastal environments.<br>
