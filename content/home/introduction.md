<!--more-->

We study ecology and evolution of marine microorganisms and viruses through a variety of field, lab, and bioinformatic approaches. The overarching goal of our research is to understand how interactions of marine microbes with diverse biotic and abiotic factors influence the marine food web and biogeochemistry. Some of our current research areas include:<br>
<br>
•	Interactions of giant viruses with microbial eukaryotes (protists).<br>
•	Linking giant viruses with their potential hosts <i>in situ</i> to answer 'who infects whom?'<br>
•	The role of viruses in modulating harmful algal blooms in coastal environments.<br>
