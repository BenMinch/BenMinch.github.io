abstract: 'Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs, also called giant viruses) are widespread in marine systems and infect a broad range of microbial eukaryotes (protists). Recent biogeographic work has provided global snapshots of NCLDV diversity and community composition across the world’s oceans, yet little information exists about the guiding ‘rules’ underpinning their community dynamics over time. We leveraged a five-year monthly metagenomic time-series to quantify the community composition of NCLDVs off the coast of Southern California and characterize these populations’ temporal dynamics. NCLDVs were dominated by Algavirales (Phycodnaviruses, 59%) and Imitervirales (Mimiviruses, 36%). We identified clusters of NCLDVs with distinct classes of seasonal and non-seasonal temporal dynamics. Overall, NCLDV population abundances were often highly dynamic with a strong seasonal signal. The Imitervirales group had highest relative abundance in the more oligotrophic late summer and fall, while Algavirales did so in winter. Generally, closely related strains had similar temporal dynamics, suggesting that evolutionary history is a key driver of the temporal niche of marine NCLDVs. However, a few closely-related strains had drastically different seasonal dynamics, suggesting that while phylogenetic proximity often indicates ecological similarity, occasionally phenology can shift rapidly, possibly due to host-switching. Finally, we identified distinct functional content and possible host interactions of two major NCLDV orders-including connections of Imitervirales with primary producers like the diatom Chaetoceros and widespread marine grazers like Paraphysomonas and Spirotrichea ciliates. Together, our results reveal key insights on season-specific effect of phylogenetically distinct giant virus communities on marine protist metabolism, biogeochemical fluxes and carbon cycling.'
