abstract: 'At the beginning of the 21st century, microbial contamination of non-sterile products is one of the major reasons for product recalls and production shutdowns (1). Contamination of oral liquid pharmaceuticals with microorganisms can bring about changes in their physical characteristics, including phase separation in emulsions, the thinning and discoloration of creams, fermentation and precipitation of syrups, flocculation in suspension and color-odor changes (2). The presence of certain microorganisms in non-sterile pharmaceutical products adversely affect the therapeutic activity of the product or even harmful for the health of the patient. As antacid and paracetamol are two widely used drugs in Bangladesh among the general population, the microbiological safety of these drugs is an important public health concern. Liquid antacids often contain ingredients of high basic pH which readily support the growth of a variety of microorganisms if appropriate precautions are not taken (3, 4). A research carried out in 2004 indicated the aerobic microbial count exceeding the USP limit in 75% of the antacid samples checked (5). From 1995 to 2002, pharmaceutical products with acetaminophen as the active ingredient have been recalled time to time by FDA of USA from markets due to contamination with aerobic bacteria exceeding the acceptable limits (1). This research elucidates the necessity of improved microbiological quality control of paracetamol and antacid suspensions from various pharmaceutical companies of Bangladesh.'
