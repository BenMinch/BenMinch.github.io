abstract: 'The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 with its diverse
signs and symptoms manifested in COVID-19
patients across different age groups and geographic
locations perplexed the clinicians and public health
experts. Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 through
continuous mutation with a limited arsenal of
treatment made the study of viral pathogenesis and
factors associated with disease outcomes in a holistic
approach inevitable, among which pre-existing
cardiovascular complications were found to be
significantly associated with adverse outcome of
COVID-19. In addition, COVID-19 has already been
reported to cause cardiac injury and different
cardiovascular complications in patients irrespective
of preexisting cardiovascular complications, which
highlights the importance of recognizing the
complications at the onset, although these arising
complications might be an indirect effect of SARSCoV-2 induced cytokine storm or hypoxia rather the
virus itself. Also, the drugs used for the clinical
management of the patients may have an impact on
the induced cardiac complications. Thus, the effect
of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiovascular system needs
to be investigated in order to predict the clinical
outcome and to devise a proper treatment strategy.
Besides, the interaction of vaccines or therapeutics
to be approved with the cardiovascular system needs
to be evaluated to avoid confounding effects leading
to cardiovascular complications followed by postapproval retraction. However, potential biomarkers
(eg. troponin, D-dimers, fibrin) associated with
cardiac injury may be potentially useful in predicting
life-threatening conditions early enough to save
lives. In conclusion, this review summarizes the
molecular pathogenesis of cardiovascular damage
caused by SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, as
well as prescribed treatment and preventative
measures.'
